    <ul>
      <li>The ladder now has <span class=emph>player stats</span>.
      <li>You can now view the <span class=emph>list of matches</span>
      a player has played by clicking on the player name on the stats
      page.
      <li>The ladder has a <span class=emph>new GUI</span>.
      <li>You can now add a <span class=emph>"headline"</span> that
      announces the results of a match. 
        <ul>
	   <li>The headline is displayed in
            the "Recent News" section of the main ladder page. 
	   <li>A default headline, which you can edit, is generated
      from the result of the match. 
           <li>If you prefer not to have your results listed in
      "Recent News", you can clear the generated headline while
      entering the match results.
         </ul>
      <li>You can now <span class=emph>cancel a challenge</span> if
      you are the challenger. If you cancel a challenge, the result of
      the match will be recorded as "cancelled".
      <li><span class=emph>Handicaps:</span> You can now optionally
      participate in handicaps by offering a handicap or challenging
      another player's handicap offer.
	<ul>
	  <li>By default, you are not participating in handicaps until
              you offer a handicap or challenge a handicap offer.
	  <li>If the challenger wins a handicap match, the challenger
              moves up one position in the ladder, the challengee
              moves down one position in the ladder. However, no
              player can move up over a player who does not participate
              in the handicap matches.
          <li>A handicap offer is available only until someone
              challenges it.
          <li>You can offer multiple handicaps and remove them when
              you wish.
